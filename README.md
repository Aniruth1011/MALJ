## Automated Toll Management

While the use of Fastag has indeed reduced waiting time at toll gates a lot , incoming vehicles still have to wait at the toll booth to get the Fastag scanned . 
We thus implement the novel solution of scanning the Number Plate of vehicles in Real Time , thus removing the need to wait at Toll Booth's. 
Using the vehicle number plate , we can easily exact the toll from their accounts. 

    ## Technical Implementation

    We used pre trained weights for number plate detection. We are attaching the links for the weights
